learn about logistic regression as a method for classification

examples of binary classification problems:
    spam vs "ham" emails
    loan default (yes/no)
    disease diagnosis

logistic regression allows us to solve classification problems, wehere we are trying to predict discrete categories

linear regression cannot be used on binary classification problems
in order to solve binary classification problems, transform the linear reegression line into a logistic regression curve

the sigmoid function (1/(1+e^(-x))) takes in any value and outputs it to be between 0 and 1

take in linear regression solution (best fitting line) and pass it through the sigmoid function, thereefore transforming it into a logistic model

set a cutoff point (usually 0.5), anything below results in class 0, everything above results in class 1

overview:
    use logistic function tto outputt a value between 0 and 1. assign a class based off that probability

use a confusion matrix to evaulate classification models
    a confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model
    for example, x axis represents the prediction outcome, and the y axis repreesents the actual outcome
    basic terminology:
        true positives
        true negatives
        false positives
        false negatives
    the total number of teests is the sum of all slots in the matrix

    accuracy: (TP+TN)/total

    missclasification: (FP+FN)/total
