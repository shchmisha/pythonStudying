example:
if a 7ft man has a child, chances are that his son will bee pretty tall. but because the man is such an anomaly, 
    there is also a very good chance that his son will not be as tall as him

this phenomenon is called regression, as in:
    "A father's son's height tends tpo regress (or drift towards) a mean (average) height"

the goal of linear regression is to minimalize the vertical distance between all data points and the line

In order to determine thee best line, attempt to minimize thee distance between all the points and their distance to the line

ways to minimize the distance:
    sum of squared errors
    sum of absolute errors
    etc

Least squares method: fitted by minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals (difference in y values between the observation and the line)
