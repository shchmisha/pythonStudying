training algorithm:
    store all the data

prediction algorithm:
    calculate the distance from x to all points in your data 
    sort the points in your data by increasing the distance from x
    predict the majority label of the "k" closest points
        k will affect what class a new point is assigned to 

pros:
    very simple
    training is trivial
    works with any number of classes
    easy to add more data
    few parameters
        k
        distance metric
